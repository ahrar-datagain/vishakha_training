# Training Repository

This repository contains training notes and exercises related to various machine learning topics.

### Training Notes

#### Topic 1: NumPy & Pandas
- Basic NumPy questions that included topics such as array creation, slicing, operations, shape & reshaping, statistics, vectorization, and broadcasting.

- In pandas covered basics of topics such as selection, filtering, grouping and merging.

#### Topic 2: Scikit learn
- Imported a dataset, trained and tested a model, and verified its performance using a custom sample input.
- Some notes on both Supervised and Unsupervised Learning topics such as linear regression, classification, clustering and PCA.

#### Topic 3: TensorFlow & Keras
- Tensor basics such as creation, operation and simple dataset model building, evaluation and prediction.
- Tensor Flow with keras - used keras for model building, and model types description.
- OCR with Tensorflow and Keras - built a digit classifier step by step.
- Image Classifier with CNN model.
- Time series forecasting with LSTM model.
