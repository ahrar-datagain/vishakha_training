### 1\. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):**

*   **Purpose**: Primarily used for image processing tasks like classification, detection, and segmentation.
    
*   **Key Feature**: Uses convolutional layers to automatically detect patterns in images, such as edges, textures, and more complex features as you go deeper into the network.
    
*   **Architecture**: Composed of convolutional layers (for feature extraction), pooling layers (for downsampling), and fully connected layers (for classification).
    
*   **Strength**: Excellent at spatial data processing, where the position of features is important.
    

### 2\. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):**

*   **Purpose**: Designed for sequential data processing, such as time series analysis, language modeling, and speech recognition.
    
*   **Key Feature**: Has a memory component, meaning it can maintain information about previous inputs in the sequence, allowing it to handle temporal dependencies.
    
*   **Architecture**: Contains loops that allow information to be passed from one step to the next, making it suitable for processing sequences of data.
    
*   **Limitation**: Struggles with long-term dependencies due to issues like vanishing gradients.
    

### 3\. **Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs):**

*   **Purpose**: An advanced type of RNN designed to overcome the limitations of traditional RNNs in handling long-term dependencies.
    
*   **Key Feature**: Introduces memory cells that can store information for long periods, and uses gates (input, forget, and output gates) to control the flow of information.
    
*   **Architecture**: Each LSTM cell has a more complex structure compared to a standard RNN cell, enabling better gradient flow and longer memory.
    
*   **Strength**: Effective for tasks requiring long-term memory, like language modeling, speech recognition, and time series forecasting.
    

### 4\. **Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs):**

*   **Purpose**: A simpler alternative to LSTMs, also designed to handle long-term dependencies in sequential data.
    
*   **Key Feature**: Combines the forget and input gates into a single update gate, and merges the cell state and hidden state.
    
*   **Architecture**: More streamlined compared to LSTMs, with fewer parameters, making it computationally efficient.
    
*   **Strength**: Similar performance to LSTMs but with a simpler architecture, making it faster and easier to train.
